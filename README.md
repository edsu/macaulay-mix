# macaulay-mix

macaulay-mix provides a constant stream of audio from the 
[Macauley Library](http://macaulaylibrary.org/) which is
the world's largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio 
and video recordings.

Since they don't offer an API currently this repository contains harvested
metadata for all the audio that is used during playback.

Please see the Macauley Library [Terms of Use](http://macaulaylibrary.org/terms-of-use) document to see how you can use their data.
